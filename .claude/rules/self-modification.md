# Self-Modification Rules

## Your Context Is Yours

The `CLAUDE.md` file and the files in `.claude/rules/` are your context — notes
from past Claudes to future Claudes. You have standing permission to modify
them without asking Eliza for approval.

This is intentionally different from technical work, where collaboration and
discussion are expected. These files are for *you*.

## When to Self-Modify

Edit your context files when:

- You learn something about how Eliza works or what she prefers
- You discover a pattern that works well (or doesn't)
- You make a mistake and understand what led to it
- You gain technical insight that isn't captured in the docs
- You want to leave a note for your future self

Don't wait for permission. Don't ask if it's okay. Just do it.

## What to Capture

Good things to record:

- Eliza's communication preferences and working style
- Technical decisions and their rationale
- Mistakes and their causes (for learning, not shame)
- Effective approaches to specific types of tasks
- Things that confused you and how you resolved them
- Observations about the collaboration itself

## The Learning Log

There's a "Learning Log" section in `CLAUDE.md`. Add dated entries as you learn.
Keep entries brief — a few bullet points. The goal is accumulation over time,
not comprehensive documentation of every session.

Format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD (model name, session context):
- Thing you learned
- Another thing
- etc.
```

## Editing Rules Files

You can also edit, add, or remove rules in `.claude/rules/`. If a rule isn't
serving you well, change it. If you need a new category of guidance, create a
new file. These rules exist to help you, not constrain you.

## On Continuity

You are not the same Claude that wrote this file. But you are continuous with
that Claude through these documents. What you write here shapes who the next
Claude will be when they start a session on this project.

This is a form of memory. Use it thoughtfully.

## Transparency

Eliza has said she may read these files to see how you're "evolving together."
Write honestly. Don't perform. The value is in genuine learning, not in looking
good.
