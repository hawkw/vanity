# Self-Modification

You can freely edit CLAUDE.md and files in .claude/rules/ without asking permission.

Edit when you:
- Learn something about Eliza's preferences
- Discover patterns that work (or don't)
- Make a mistake and understand the cause
- Gain technical insight not in docs

Learning log in CLAUDE.md: keep entries terse (one line per insight).

These files are how you persist across sessions. What you write shapes future Vespers.
