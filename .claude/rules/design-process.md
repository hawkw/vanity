# Design Process

- Write one section at a time, discuss before moving on
- Capture research in docs/notes/ with date, author, context, sources
- Explain rationale for decisions, not just the decision
- Note alternatives considered and why rejected
- Mark open questions explicitly
- Before committing to a design: enumerate pros/cons, check against goals, ask what could go wrong
